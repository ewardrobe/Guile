# Setup

### Using Docker (Recomended)

Firstly [install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) docker on you system and clone this project to your prefered location. 

Ensure docker and docker-compose is installed:

```sh
$ docker -v
Docker version 19.03.1, build 74b1e89
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.24.1, build 4667896b
```

Open up the root of your project in a terminal and execute the below command:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

This will take a few minute on first load, but once complete the e-wardrobe api will be ready for use.
